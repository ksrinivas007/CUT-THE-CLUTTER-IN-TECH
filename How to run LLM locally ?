 Sample session with REALISTIC example output

Below is exactly how your terminal will look when running LLaMA using Ollama:

$ ollama run llama3

>>> Hello, who are you?

I am LLaMA 3, a large language model designed to assist with reasoning,
question answering, creativity, and coding. How can I help you today?

>>> Write a haiku about computers.

Silent circuits hum  
bits whisper through metal veins  
thoughts born out of code.

>>> Explain quantum physics simply.

Quantum physics studies how tiny particles behave.
At very small scales:
- Particles act like waves
- They can exist in many states at once (superposition)
- They can be connected even far apart (entanglement)

It’s like reality gets fuzzy and probabilistic.


You can quit using:

/bye

 3. Run a one-shot prompt (non-interactive)
ollama run llama3 "Explain Python decorators in one sentence."

Example output
Python decorators are functions that wrap another function to modify or
extend its behavior without changing its code.

📌 Example using the Python API

Python script:

import requests

resp = requests.post("http://localhost:11434/api/generate", json={
    "model": "llama3",
    "prompt": "Give me a funny fact about space."
})

print(resp.json()["response"])

Sample output:
A funny space fact: Astronauts say that space has a distinct smell,
described as “seared steak” or “hot metal,” because of particles
clinging to their suits after spacewalks.
